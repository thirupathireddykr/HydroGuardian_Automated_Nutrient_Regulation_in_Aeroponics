**#HyderoGuardian Automated Nutrient Regulation in Aeroponics**

Aeroponics, a soil-less cultivation technique, represents a paradigm shift in modern agriculture, 
suspending plant roots in air or mist to foster growth. The innovative approach of aeroponics eliminates 
the need for traditional soil mediums, offering numerous advantages such as optimized nutrient uptake, 
enhanced oxygenation, and efficient use of resources. With a focus on revolutionizing aeroponic 
cultivation, our project centers on the development of a comprehensive system leveraging advanced 
technologies. At its core, the system integrates an Arduino microcontroller alongside pH and Total 
Dissolved Solids (TDS) sensors, meticulously calibrated to monitor crucial parameters essential for 
plant health and growth. By continuously monitoring pH levels and water quality management, 
including TDS concentration and nutrient solution levels, the system ensures optimal growing 
conditions are maintained. Moreover, the system facilitates data analysis over time, providing regular 
displays of parameters for trend analysis. Scalability is a key consideration, with the system designed to 
send alerts for parameter deviations and the potential for real-time data expansion, ensuring 
adaptability to varying agricultural needs and environments. Additionally, the integration of a 
Bluetooth module enables seamless data collection from pH and TDS sensors, transmitting information 
to an Android application for remote monitoring and management. Automation further enhances 
system functionality, with automatic motor control based on pH levels, operating the water pump as 
needed to maintain pH levels within predefined thresholds of less than 5.5 or greater than 6.5. Through 
this holistic approach, our project aims to drive innovation in aeroponic agriculture, promoting 
sustainability, efficiency, and productivity in modern farming practices
